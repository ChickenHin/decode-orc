# Plugin Publishing Guide

How to package, release, and distribute a third-party Decode-Orc stage plugin so
users can install it — either from a hand-written registry entry or, preferably,
from the curated plugin index.

This is the release-side companion to the
[Plugin Author Guide](plugin-author-guide.md) (which covers building and loading
a plugin locally). Reference material lives in
[Plugin SDK Developer Guide → Distribution](plugin-sdk.md#distribution) and
[Plugin Architecture](plugin-architecture.md).

---

## 1. Repository naming (recommended)

Prefer hosting your plugin in its own repository named with the `orc-plugin_`
prefix:

```
orc-plugin_<stage-name>     e.g.  orc-plugin_deinterlace
```

This convention matches the release-asset naming below and makes plugin
repositories easy to recognise, but it is not enforced — a plugin may live in
a repository with any name (or a subdirectory of a larger project) as long as
its releases publish conforming assets and the release manifest in §3.

---

## 2. Release-asset naming

Publish platform binaries as GitHub release assets using:

```
orc-plugin_<stage-name>_<platform>[_abi<N>].<ext>
```

where `<platform>` is `linux` / `macos` / `windows`, `<ext>` is
`so` / `dylib` / `dll`, and the optional `_abi<N>` token records the **host ABI**
the binary was built against:

```
orc-plugin_deinterlace_linux_abi12.so
orc-plugin_deinterlace_macos_abi12.dylib
orc-plugin_deinterlace_windows_abi12.dll
```

The name is a validity convention (the host rejects downloads whose names do
not match it); which asset a host actually installs is decided by the release
manifest below, not by parsing names. Find the ABI number you built against
in the [SDK version history](plugin-sdk.md#version-history)
(`host_abi_version`).

The skeleton CI workflows produce and upload these artifacts automatically on
tagged releases.

---

## 3. Release manifest (required)

Every release **must** include an `orc-plugin-manifest.yaml` asset declaring
each binary's platform, host ABI, toolchain tag, and SHA-256 digest — a
release without one cannot be browsed, installed, or updated to:

```yaml
manifest_schema: 1
plugin_id: org.example.stage.deinterlace
plugin_version: 1.0.0
artifacts:
  - file: orc-plugin_deinterlace_linux_abi12.so
    platform: linux
    abi: 12
    toolchain_tag: gcc14/libstdc++
    sha256: 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08
```

`file`, `platform`, and a non-zero `abi` are required per artifact;
`toolchain_tag` (the `ORC_SDK_TOOLCHAIN_TAG` your build produced) and `sha256`
are strongly recommended — the host uses them to refuse installs that are
guaranteed to fail at load, and to verify (and quarantine on mismatch) every
download and cache hit. Compute digests with `sha256sum <file>` (macOS:
`shasum -a 256 <file>`). See
[Release manifest](plugin-architecture.md#release-manifest) for the full
schema and matching rules.

> Plugin binaries are **not code-signed**. See
> [Distribution integrity](plugin-architecture.md#distribution-integrity) for
> exactly what the digest does and does not guarantee, and the roadmap toward a
> signed index.

## 4. Rebuild expectations on host ABI bumps

The plugin boundary is a **C++ ABI**, not a C ABI — vtables, `std::shared_ptr`,
`std::string`, and STL containers cross it. Matching version numbers are
necessary but not sufficient: the plugin must be built with the same compiler
family, C++ standard library, and build configuration as the host (encoded in
the descriptor's `toolchain_tag` and checked for exact equality at load).

Consequences for publishing:

- **When `host_abi_version` increases**, you must rebuild against the new SDK
  and publish a new asset tagged `_abi<new>`. The host refuses to load binaries
  built against an older ABI. Keep the older-ABI asset in the release so users
  on older hosts still have a compatible build.
- **When `plugin_api_version` increases**, update your stage implementation to
  the new contract and recompile.
- Neither increment happens without a corresponding Decode-Orc release and
  migration notes. Watch the
  [version history](plugin-sdk.md#version-history) and the
  [ABI impact decision table](plugin-sdk.md#abi-impact-decision-table).

Before tagging a release, run the SDK enforcement gates in standalone mode
against your repository (see
[Plugin Author Guide §6](plugin-author-guide.md#6-run-the-sdk-enforcement-gates-standalone)).

## 5. Distribute via a hand-written registry entry

Users can register your plugin directly by adding an entry to their plugin
registry YAML:

```yaml
- plugin_id:          com.example.deinterlace
  plugin_version:     "1.0.0"
  source_repo_url:    https://github.com/example/orc-plugin_deinterlace
  artifact_source:    github_release_asset
  release_asset_url:  https://github.com/example/orc-plugin_deinterlace/releases/download/v1.0.0/orc-plugin_deinterlace_linux_abi12.so
  release_tag:        v1.0.0
  release_asset_name: orc-plugin_deinterlace_linux_abi12.so
  target_platform:    linux
  required_host_abi:  12
  enabled:            true
  trust_state:        untrusted
  license_spdx:       GPL-3.0-or-later
  sha256:             9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08
```

Set `required_host_abi` so an incompatible entry is reported (and neither
downloaded nor loaded) instead of failing late at `dlopen`. Entries default to
`trust_state: untrusted`; the host downloads and loads only after the user
grants trust (ticking **Enabled** in the Plugin Manager, or `orc-cli plugins
trust <id>`). See [Registry entry](plugin-sdk.md#registry-entry).

---

## 6. Distribute via the curated index (recommended)

The curated index is the list users browse under **Plugin Manager → Browse
Plugins…** and query with `orc-cli plugins search / info / install`. It lives in
[`orc-plugin-registry/`](https://github.com/decode-orc/decode-orc/tree/main/orc-plugin-registry){target="_blank"} and the host fetches it from
the default-branch head over HTTPS — **a merged pull request publishes
immediately**, with no Decode-Orc release and no registry tag.

The index curates **which plugins are offered, not their versions**: the host
resolves your repository's **latest published release** at browse and install
time, and offers each new release to installed users as an update. Publishing
a new release therefore requires **no** registry change — keep your latest
release working and correctly named, because it is what users get.

Submit an entry:

1. Fork the registry and append your plugin under `plugins:` in `index.yaml`,
   following [`registry_schema: 2`](https://github.com/decode-orc/decode-orc/blob/main/orc-plugin-registry/README.md){target="_blank"}:

   ```yaml
   - id: com.example.deinterlace
     display_name: Example Deinterlacer
     description: Motion-adaptive deinterlacing for PAL/NTSC
     maintainer: Example Author
     license_spdx: GPL-3.0-or-later
     source_repo_url: https://github.com/example/orc-plugin_deinterlace
     tags: [transform, video]
   ```

2. Make sure your **latest GitHub release** publishes one conforming binary
   per platform you support **and the `orc-plugin-manifest.yaml` from §3** —
   without the manifest the host refuses to browse, install, or update to the
   release. The host installs exactly what the manifest declares for the
   user's platform, and a user on an unsupported platform, ABI, or toolchain
   is told precisely why rather than downloading an incompatible binary. Tag
   releases `v<version>` so the host can report and compare versions.

3. Validate locally before opening the PR:

   ```bash
   # Offline: schema, license, repository URL
   python3 orc-plugin-registry/tools/validate_index.py orc-plugin-registry/index.yaml

   # Online as well: latest release publishes a conforming plugin asset
   python3 orc-plugin-registry/tools/validate_index.py --online orc-plugin-registry/index.yaml
   ```

4. Open the pull request. CI validates schema conformance, a valid SPDX
   `license_spdx`, a GitHub `source_repo_url`, and that your latest release
   publishes a conforming plugin asset. Only GPLv3-compatible licenses are
   accepted.

**A maintainer's merge is the curation decision** and publishes the entry —
it endorses your repository, so every release you publish afterwards is
offered to users automatically. Users then install with:

```console
$ orc-cli plugins search deinterlace
$ orc-cli plugins info com.example.deinterlace
$ orc-cli plugins install com.example.deinterlace   # latest release, untrusted
$ orc-cli plugins trust com.example.deinterlace      # user confirms trust
```

Installing from the index records an entry pointing at your latest release and
leaves it untrusted until the user confirms — the same trust flow as the GUI
**Browse Plugins…** dialog. Users are re-asked to confirm trust after every
update, since each release is a new binary.
