/**
 * @brief Thread-safe, memory-budgeted store of provenance-keyed observations.

 * Records are keyed by ObservationRecordKey so they are tied to frame *content*
 * rather than to a live DAG node. The store is the sole thread-safe handoff
 * point between the (single-threaded) renderer/scheduler and any reader.
 *
 * Eviction: an approximate byte budget bounds memory. put() and retain_only()
 * evict least-recently-used records once usage exceeds the budget. get(),
 * load_into() and put() mark a record most-recently-used.
 *
 * Read-through: when a persistence sidecar is attached, has()/get()/load_into()
 * fall back to it on an in-memory miss and re-install the record — memory is a
 * cache over the durable sidecar, so budget eviction never causes derived data
 * to be recomputed, only reloaded. Without a sidecar (or for records that never
 * reached it) a miss is genuine.
 *
 * Thread safety (coding standards §5.3.3): every public method is safe to call
 * concurrently from any thread; all state is guarded by an internal mutex. The
 * sidecar is consulted outside that mutex so database I/O never blocks
 * in-memory reads on other threads.
