/**
 * @brief The flash phase every animating catalogue view shares
 *
 * Teletext flashing text and the NAPLPS blink process are the same idea: the
 * foreground alternates between being drawn and not, on a cycle the receiver
 * owns rather than the transmission. One clock drives every view so a page and
 * a display list shown in the same dialogue flash together, and so a viewer
 * switching between them does not restart the cycle under the reader.
 *
 * Subscribers are counted: the timer runs only while at least one view is
 * visible and actually holds something that flashes. A catalogue browser left
 * open on a still page costs nothing.
 *
 * The phase is derived from a monotonic clock rather than counted off the
 * timer. Timer resolution and coalescing differ on every platform — Windows'
 * default tick, macOS timer coalescing, compositor throttling on Wayland — and
 * a phase toggled per timeout drifts under all of them.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: a Qt widget clock, used from the GUI thread only.
