/**
 * @brief Modeless preview of the closed captions the previewer has passed
 *
 * An observer dialog (owned by MainWindow, raised from the preview window's
 * Observers menu) that follows the frame previewer. Like its teletext sibling
 * it is stateful: EIA-608 carries two bytes per frame and builds a caption out
 * of them over a second or more, so what is on screen at any one frame is the
 * result of a run of frames before it, not of that frame's own data (see
 * ClosedCaptionAssembler).
 *
 * What it shows is a transcript of the captions decoded so far, each with the
 * frame it appeared at, so a caption can be found again in the recording. The
 * transcript follows the previewer: the caption that would be on screen at the
 * preview frame is marked in it and scrolled to as that frame moves, which is
 * what tells a reader the captions really are keeping step with the picture.
 *
 * Status text lives in a status bar along the bottom edge so transient messages
 * never reflow the transcript, and the recovered byte pair of the current frame
 * is shown there too — it is the observation itself, and the only way to tell a
 * frame carrying nothing from one whose bytes did not decode.
 *
 * MainWindow drives it: setCurrentFrame() on frame changes, then issues one
 * requestClosedCaptionData() per frame reported by framesNeedingData() and
 * feeds the responses back through deliverFrameData().
