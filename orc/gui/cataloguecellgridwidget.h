/**
 * @brief Paints a character-cell grid payload
 *
 * The grid is drawn into an aspect-locked rect built from the nominal character
 * rectangle the payload carries, so glyphs and mosaic blocks keep their
 * proportions whatever shape the widget is given.
 *
 * Alphanumeric cells use the system monospace font; mosaic cells are painted as
 * 2x3 sub-element blocks, contiguous or separated. Cell attributes are
 * honoured: foreground and background out of the payload's own palette, double
 * height (the character spans both rows at unchanged width), boxing on a
 * boxed-only page, conceal (rendered as SPACE — no reveal control) and flash
 * (animated against a CatalogueFlashClock, or held in its lit phase when there
 * is no clock or animation is switched off). The palette travels with the
 * payload rather than being theme-derived, because a service with a fixed
 * display palette means it.
 *
 * Painting is two-pass — every background first, then every foreground —
 * because a double-height character occupies the row below its origin and a
 * row-sequential paint would erase its lower half.
