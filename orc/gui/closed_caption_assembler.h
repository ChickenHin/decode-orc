/**
 * @brief Trailing-frame-window byte cache and caption-screen history
 *
 * The closed caption preview dialog follows the frame previewer through a
 * stream that carries only two bytes per frame: what is on screen at any one
 * frame is the result of every byte before it, not of that frame's own data.
 * So the assembler decodes a trailing window of frames ending at the current
 * frame and records the caption screen as it changes.
 *
 * The record is a *history* keyed by the frame the screen changed at, which is
 * both what the dialog renders (the screen at the previewer's frame is the
 * newest entry at or before it) and what it lists (each entry with a caption on
 * it is a caption the recording showed). Keeping the changes rather than a
 * per-frame snapshot costs one entry per caption instead of one per frame, and
 * makes stepping backwards inside the decoded span exact rather than a
 * re-decode.
 *
 * Frames are fed to a *persistent* decoder in ascending order and never decoded
 * twice: the decoder is a state machine that cannot be rewound, and re-running
 * the window on every frame change would repeat the same work for the whole
 * window at every step. The consequence is that a frame arriving after the
 * decoder has passed it cannot contribute — see storeFrame().
 *
 * Qt-free by design so caption assembly is unit-testable without a
 * QApplication. Thread safety: none; confine an instance to the GUI thread.
