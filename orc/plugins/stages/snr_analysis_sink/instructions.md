# SNR Analysis Sink

Estimates the signal-to-noise ratio of the incoming video stream and displays white SNR and black SNR measurements per field. Use this sink to quantify noise improvement from stacking or to compare the SNR of different capture setups.

## When to use

Connect this stage after each source or after the Stacker stage when you want to measure the noise level in the signal. Comparing SNR before and after stacking shows the noise reduction achieved. Comparing SNR between two capture setups identifies which has better signal quality. Higher SNR means less noise and a better decode quality.

## What it does

Estimates signal-to-noise ratio using spatial and temporal analysis of the incoming video stream. Reports white SNR and black SNR per field. Computes per-field measurements and aggregate statistics. After triggering, the SNR Analysis tool is automatically invoked to display the results in a chart window. Results are consistent across comparable pipelines, allowing meaningful cross-capture comparison. The dataset is cached and can be retrieved from the Stage Tools menu after the trigger completes.

## Parameters

### output_path (file path)
Destination CSV file for the SNR metrics. Leave empty to skip file output.

### write_csv (bool)
Enable writing the results to CSV at trigger time. Default: `false`.

### mode (choice: white, black, both)
Selects which SNR metrics to measure. Default: `both`.

## CSV output

The CSV is written from the canonical per-frame dataset — **one row per frame**;
the stage analyses every frame. Each row carries the frame's *true* frame
number. An absent metric is written as an **empty field** — never the string
`nan`. The CSV always contains full-resolution per-frame data and is never
affected by the display decimation used to draw the graph.

Columns (units are carried in the header names; values are plain numbers):

| Column | Unit | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `frame_number` | — | Frame number (1-based) |
| `white_snr_db` | dB | White SNR for the frame (empty if not measured) |
| `black_psnr_db` | dB | Black PSNR for the frame (empty if not measured) |

Example (`mode = white` measures white SNR only, so the black column is empty):

```csv
frame_number,white_snr_db,black_psnr_db
1,42.5,
2,42.1,
3,41.9,
```

## Tools

### SNR Analysis
Displays white SNR and black SNR metrics over time in a chart window. This tool is automatically invoked after the stage is triggered.

The dataset stays with the stage afterwards, so closing the window and picking **SNR Analysis** from the **Stage Tools** menu re-opens it immediately, reading what the last trigger produced without measuring again. That menu entry only ever reads: on a stage that has not been triggered it says there is nothing to show rather than starting the analysis itself, because deciding when to spend that time is what **Trigger Stage** is for. Editing any stage's parameters rebuilds the graph and discards every stage's results, closing the open windows with them — trigger again for a dataset that matches the new settings.

## Notes

- SNR results are comparable across pipelines using the same measurement methodology, making cross-capture comparison meaningful.
- Connect one instance after each source and one after the Stacker to see the SNR improvement from stacking.
- This stage does not modify the video stream; it is a pure sink.

## Status Indicator

The coloured dot in the top-right corner of the node shows its configuration status.

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Green | Fully configured and ready to run. All required parameters are set. |
| Yellow | Partially configured. The stage can run but will use default or reduced behaviour — for example, pass-through mode or console-only output. Review the parameters for optional settings. |
| Red | Not configured. One or more required parameters are missing and the stage cannot run. |

Parameters can be set via **Edit Parameters...** in the node context menu. Some stages also provide interactive stage tools (listed under **Tools** above) that set parameters directly from within the tool.
