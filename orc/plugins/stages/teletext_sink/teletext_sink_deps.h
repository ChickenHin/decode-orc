/**
 * @brief Runs the analysis pass: frame loop, packet writer, page catalogue.
 *
 * One linear pass over the frame range slices every candidate VBI line with
 * TeletextFrameSlicer, writes the recovered packets as the service's flat
 * stream (.t42 on 625 lines, .t34 on 525), and feeds the same packets to a
 * page decoder whose snapshots build the catalogue the stage tool displays.
 *
 * Nothing is read from or written to the observation store: the stage owns its
 * decoding end to end, which is what lets its tuning parameters mean anything.
