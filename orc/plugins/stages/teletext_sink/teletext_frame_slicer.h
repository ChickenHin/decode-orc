 * System B only: 625 lines per ETSI EN 300 706 (PAL) and 525 per ITU-R BT.653
 * Table 1b (NTSC and PAL_M). NABTS, the other BT.653 service carried on the
 * same 525-line VBI lines, is recovered by the nabts_sink stage, which has its
 * own copy of this pass — see docs-tech/nabts-support-design.md §2 for why the
 * two are not one.
 *
 * Thread safety: slice_field() is const and the class holds no mutable state;
 * a single instance may be used concurrently from multiple threads.
