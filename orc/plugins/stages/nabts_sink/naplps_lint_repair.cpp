 *   - A locking shift, SO or SI (§6.1.3), which is the other half of the same
 *     thing: it says which slot is in use.
 *   - DOMAIN and RESET (§5.3.2.2, §5.3.2.9), which set how many bytes an
 *     operand word occupies. Change one and every coordinate in the record is
 *     read from different six-bit groups.
 *
 * A correction to one of these is not a local repair whatever the grammar makes
 * of it, and neither is a correction *into* one — so the test is applied to the
