 * transport added. The slicer nevertheless sweeps the whole CEA-516 §2.3
 * window on every line, because a slicer looking at one line in isolation has
 * no way to know that.
 *
 * This accumulates the lock positions of lines that did yield packets and,
 * once enough of them agree, offers them back as a TeletextPhaseHint. The hint
 * is advisory in the strongest sense: a hinted attempt that fails is retried
 * over the full window (see TeletextPhaseHint), so a tracker that has learned
 * the wrong thing costs time and nothing else.
