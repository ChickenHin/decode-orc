// The defaults are the 8 x fsc to 4 x fsc case the card captures need.  With a
// cutoff at 90 % of the output Nyquist the transition band closes about
// 8.7 MHz, which leaves the 6.9375 MHz WST carrier well inside the passband
// while putting everything that would fold onto it into the stopband
// (design §5.5).
struct VBIResamplerConfig {
  // Kernel half-width in source samples; the filter uses twice this many taps.
  //
  // This sets how narrow the transition band can be, and the WST carrier is
  // what makes it matter: at 6.9375 MHz the carrier is only 1 MHz below the
  // cutoff, so a shorter kernel would put the top of the data band inside the
  // filter's own rolloff and attenuate exactly the content the slicer reads.
  // A hundred and twenty-eight taps gives about 80 dB of stopband for the 2:1
  // case with room to spare either side.

  // transition band lands inside the output band instead of straddling Nyquist
  // and folding onto itself.

  //
  // A thousandth of a source sample is 28 ps at the bt8x8 rate, four orders of
  // magnitude below the tenth of an output sample placement is judged to, and
  // it bounds what the phase bank can cost on a source whose resampling ratio
  // is irrational.

// Low-pass-and-resample in one pass, over the fixed window a placement gives.
//
// Decimating an 8 x fsc capture by dropping every other sample would alias the
// 6.9375 MHz WST carrier straight back onto itself, because it sits at 78 % of
// the 8.87 MHz output Nyquist; the anti-alias filter is not optional
// (design §5.5).  Filtering and fractional delay are the same operation here:
// the kernel is centred on the requested position, which both band-limits and
// interpolates, and its symmetry is what makes the group delay zero — a value
// asked for at position p is the waveform at p, not at p plus a filter delay.
//
// Nothing else happens to the samples.  No slicing, sharpening, level
// restoration or re-quantisation: a deconvolving slicer downstream recovers
// data by matching the blurred waveform it is given, and conditioning would
// destroy exactly the information it depends on (design §5.3.6).
//
// Every output sample of every data line of every frame reads its record at
// the same set of positions, because the placement is one map for the whole
// run.  The kernel is therefore resolved once, at construction: each output
// sample is reduced to the record sample its kernel is centred on and a row of
// weights, and the rows are shared by every output sample that lands on the
// same fractional delay.  A capture whose rate is a whole multiple of the
// output's — which is every card capture in the design's table — has one such
// delay and so one row, small enough to stay in the innermost cache for the
// whole of a frame.  What is left at run time is a flat multiply-accumulate
// per output sample with no arithmetic on the kernel at all.
//
// Each row is normalised to sum to one, which is what keeps a constant region
// such as the quiet back porch from rippling by the kernel's phase-to-phase
// gain variation, and what lets the amplitude map be applied to the output
// rather than to every stored sample.  Positions near either end of the record
// read the nearest stored sample: constant extension keeps a quiet head or
// tail at its own level rather than pulling it towards an invented zero, which
// would be a step edge in the middle of the sample path.
//
// Immutable after construction; const members are safe to call concurrently.
