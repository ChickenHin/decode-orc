// A raw VBI capture has no sidecars: the whole of the stage's external I/O is
// opening one file and reading bytes out of it, so this interface is the byte
// transport and nothing else.  Unit tests substitute an in-memory byte source
// and never touch the filesystem.

// Raw VBI capture source stage.
//
// Third-party VBI captures — bt8x8 and family card dumps, cropped VBI-only
// .tbc files — hold nothing but the teletext lines.  This stage reads those
// line records and lays them onto CVBS frames at the timing point and the
// amplitude the standard puts them at, so that the existing teletext decoders
// see them exactly as they see them on a native decode (design §1).
//
// The rest of each frame is blanking.  A capture carries no sync, no vertical
// interval and no burst, and nothing that reads this stage's output looks for
// them: the teletext slicer locks to the clock run-in within the line it is
// handed.  Manufacturing a whole television signal around the data would cost
// far more than placing the data does and would be spent entirely on samples
// nobody reads.
//
// Nothing is written to disk: the stage's only product is the in-memory
// CVBS_U10_4FSC representation.  Connect the CVBS sink to export it.
//
// Frames are built lazily, one at a time, on the frame a consumer asks for.
// A PAL frame is 1,4 MB against the 64 KiB of VBI records it comes from, so a
// four-hour capture is 24 GB of records and 522 GB of frames; materialising it
// is not an option (design §5.7).
//
// The user's whole choice is one named preset per capture format, and the list
// is filtered to the project's own television system: a PAL project is offered
// one and an NTSC project two.  A preset is a complete configuration — the
// container geometry, the data service the capture carries, the level policy,
// the capture offset and the field order — because every one of those is a
// property of the format rather than something a user could be expected to
// know.  There is no "custom" preset: a format nobody has measured cannot be
// described by guessing at its fields, and one that has been measured is a
// single data entry in the preset table.
//
// The data service is part of the preset rather than an axis of its own,
// because nothing in a capture records which of the two 525-line services it
// carries — they share their lines and their bit rate and differ in framing
// code and packet length — and because what it decides is less than its name
// suggests.  It supplies the data region the record is clipped to, the pattern
// the capture offset is fitted against, the windows the logic levels are read
// from, and the amplitude those levels map onto.  On a card capture all four
// matter.  On a TBC-derived capture the record is copied index for index and
// its levels are absolute, so only the first survives: the service decides how
// much of the line is copied and nothing else.  It is carried onto the output
// either way, so a decoder is told rather than left to assume — and whether the
// host can decode what was placed is the slicer's business, not this stage's.
