// The output frame timeline of a capture that is synthesised lazily.
//
// VBIFrameTimeline is the same model built by observing every stored frame in
// order, which is what a run that reads the whole capture does.  This index is
// for the run that does not: frames are synthesised on demand and in whatever
// order they are asked for, and a four-hour capture holds 368 007 of them, so
// reading every frame's counter to find out how many output frames there are
// would decode the entire capture before the first frame could be shown.
//
// It does not have to.  The driver's counter advances once per captured frame
// whether or not the frame reached the file, so for a capture with no drops
// counter(n) - counter(0) == n at every n.  Two counter reads therefore
// establish the total number of dropped frames across the whole capture, and
// because the counter is monotonic, the stored frame carrying any given output
// frame is found by bisection over a range that the drop total bounds — one
// read for a capture that dropped nothing, which is the overwhelmingly common
// case (design §6.3).
//
// Not thread-safe: resolving a frame reads counters through the borrowed
// source, which holds a stream position.  Callers serialise access, as they
// already must for the reader.
