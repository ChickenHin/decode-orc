// the quiet region ahead of the clock run-in, and logic 1 from the larger of
// the run-in's peaks and the framing code's leading run of ones.  Taking the
// larger is what stops a band-limited source under-scaling: on the VHS waveform
// measured in design §5.3.6 the run-in has collapsed to a few per cent of the
// data amplitude, and normalising to it would produce output at a fraction of
// the correct amplitude.
//
// The mapping the levels imply is linear and nothing else is done to the
// samples.  A deconvolving slicer downstream recovers data by matching the
// blurred waveform it is given, so any sharpening, slicing or re-quantisation
// here would destroy the information it depends on (design §5.3.6).

// The mapper works on a whole stored frame at a time.  That is what makes

// order they are asked for, so a window carried across frames would make a
// frame's output depend on which frames were read before it.
