// is a 625-line signal carrying the same World System Teletext, so the output
// geometry and the data service are the PAL ones too.

// What differs is how much of the line list can carry teletext.  A SECAM
// transmission with vertical colour identification puts the identification
// signal — a continuous 4,4 MHz burst, the "green bottles" — on frame lines
