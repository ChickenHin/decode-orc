/**
 * @brief What combining repeated copies of a page row changed
 *
 * Fed the before and after form of every row packet the rewrite pass emits,
 * this answers the question the packet count cannot: whether squashing had
 * anything to work with, and whether what it did was an improvement.
 *
 * The reading is the odd-parity failure count either side of the rewrite.
 * ETSI EN 300 706 §8.1 gives every display byte odd parity, so a byte that
 * fails it is known to be damaged: parity failures falling is squashing
 * removing damage it could prove was there. They are not a full error count —
 * a byte damaged in two bits passes parity and is invisible here — but they
 * are the only measure available without the original transmission, and they
 * move in the right direction for the right reason.
 *
 * The copies-per-row distribution is the other half. A row transmitted once
 * cannot be corrected however good the vote is, so a run whose rows are mostly
 * single-copy has not failed to squash — it had nothing to squash. The two
 * figures separate "the recording is too short, or the page came round too
 * rarely" from "the copies disagreed and the vote could not settle it".
 *
 * Pure accumulation: no I/O, no clock.
 *
 * Thread safety: none; confine an instance to one thread.
