/**
 * @file
 * @brief What a stage that catalogues *things* hands the host to show
 *
 * A stage that decodes a data service over a frame range ends up with a set of
 * items — pages, records, cues — each of which a reader wants listed and then
 * looked at one at a time. Before this contract existed, each such stage needed
 * the host to grow a viewer that knew its data model, which is why the host
 * carried a teletext page viewer and a NABTS record viewer and could not have
 * accepted a third from outside the tree at all.
 *
 * Nothing here names a service. An item is an id, some column values and a
 * payload; a payload is a character-cell grid, a 2D display list, a text
 * document or a table. Those four cover a WST page, a NAPLPS record, a function
 * listing and a cue track, and they are the shapes a broadcast data service
 * presents in generally — the host draws them and stays ignorant of the rest.
 *
 * Everything is resolved on the plugin's side of the boundary: colours are RGB
 * or palette indices with the palette attached, characters are Unicode, and
 * geometry is in a unit space. A renderer walks a payload and needs no state
 * and no decoder.
