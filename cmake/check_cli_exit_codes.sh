#!/usr/bin/env bash
# File:        check_cli_exit_codes.sh
# Purpose:     Gate: the `plugins` and `stages` commands return the documented
#              exit code for every outcome, and none of them blocks on input
#              that cannot arrive.
#
# Usage:       check_cli_exit_codes.sh <path-to-orc-cli>
#
# The codes are defined in orc/cli/cli_exit_codes.h and documented in
# docs/cli-user-guide/overview.md; a script tells "does not exist" from "the
# network was down" from "you declined to trust a binary" by them, so each is
# pinned here rather than left to WILL_FAIL, which any non-zero code satisfies.
#
# Registry-only: the fixture registry is built under a redirected
# HOME/XDG_CONFIG_HOME, the curated index is seeded as an empty last-good cache
# and its fetch pointed at a closed port. Every invocation reads stdin from
# /dev/null, so a command that decided to wait for an answer fails the gate
# instead of hanging it. Kept bash-3.2 compatible.
